# Practical Machine Learning Coursera Project

Project report is here: http://map0logo.github.io/predmachlearn-011/

The project file organization tries to follow the site schema from http://projecttemplate.net, but is not automated.

Data is in `data` folder, and the report source (.Rmd file) is in the `report` folder. Some "proof of concept" scripts are in `src` folder.
