```{r}
ml_training <- read.csv("data/pml-training.csv")
summary(pml_training)
```

Summary() funtion shows that there are empty values in fields as "min_yaw_belt"
and "#DIV/0!" values in fields as "min_yaw_forearm" that make that these fields
are taken as factor. So, this values has to be read as NA.

```{r}
pml_training <- read.csv("data/pml-training.csv", na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))
summary(pml_training) # no more incorrect factor fields
```
Some columns had a lot of missing values and the others none. So take only
columns without missing values.

```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width=6}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(1:ncol(pml_training), colSums(is.na(pml_training)), xlab = "col", ylab = "# of NAs")
```
